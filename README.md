# Reverse Engineering

Documenting my thought process for the RE challenges that I've worked on.
My goal is to get more experience reverse engineering binaries using tools like [Radare2](https://rada.re/) and [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/).

I've been using platforms like [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) and [Crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one) to hack the flags and passwords.
Some challenges involve creating a python script for brute-forcing the password, and other challenges are purely based on reading the assembly code.
